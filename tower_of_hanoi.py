# This is an implementation of tower of hanoi 

# some pre determined rules
# 1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
# 2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
# 3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
# minimal amount of moves to solve the tower of hanoi is 2^n - 1 where n is the number of disks
# this is a recursive solution

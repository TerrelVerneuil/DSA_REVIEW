# A Heap is a complete binary tree data structure 
# that satisfies the heap property: for every node, 
# the value of its children is greater than or equal 
# to its own value. Heaps are usually used to 
# implement priority queues, where the smallest 
# (or largest) element is always at the root of the tree.

# Binary Heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property.
